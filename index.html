            <h3>What helps you to be successful as a team?</h3>
            <p>Great leadership, communication and shared struggle. I was worried about this being remote, but the slack channel has really helped to keep me plugged in to not feel so isolated.</p>

            <h3>How did you do this sprint?</h3>
            <p>I think I did ok, but I could have done much better. The first two days were a huge struggle for me, and I still have assignments from those days that I need to return to and work through. The second half of the week felt much more productive, although I do think I could have pushed myself to achieve stretch goals and challenge myself more.</p>

            <h3>Where and when did it go wrong in this sprint?</h3>
            <p>The bug on our first day and the W3 Git and Github tutorial were very difficult for me to work through. I still haven’t finished either assignment, but plan to revisit them and at least get repetitions and hopefully gain a better understanding of the material. </p>

            <h3>What do you expect, from who?</h3>
            <p>I expect to learn a great deal everyday and grow as a developer over the coming months from my instructors, classmates and the material provided to us.</p>

            <h3>Which tools or techniques proved to be useful?</h3>
            <p>I would have to say the full spectrum of everything combined has been an enormous help throughout this week. We have been provided a wide variety of material through both our assigned work as well as extra resources that address individual and group concerns. Josh and Andrew have done great job pacing the class so that anyone struggling is provided assistance, while those advancing quickly are provided more opportunities to stretch and explore. </p>

            <h3>What is your biggest impediment?</h3>
            <p>The fully remote format has been a challenge. I enjoy being physically present with my instructors and classmates, and the bond that that can build, so it’s been an adjustment for me especially when it comes to asking questions and interacting with everyone. It is nice to not have to pack a lunch and commute though! That being said, I do hope that by being challenged in a remote setting I will be better equipped to work remotely in the future if needed.</p>

            <h3>If you could change 1 thing, what would it be?</h3>
            <p>It would be nice to be in-person, but I can’t say that I would change anything. I’m enjoying the process so far, and really enjoy working with and learning from my instructors and classmates.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <h3>01.26.23</h3>

    <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

    <p>So far the first week of bootcamp has been mix of expected and unexepected experiences. Leading up to day 1, we were given a lot of material to read through which outlines what we could expect entering the first week and beyond. However, I had not anticipated having such a difficult time understanding and becoming comfortable with Git and GitHub. I am still working on assignments from the first two days, with very litle progress, but I am improving slowly each time I attempt working through the tutorials. Moving into HTML and CSS yesterday was a nice break from CLI and Git commands. I will need to spend extra time working on Git and GitHub over the coming days to ensure that I don't slow my self down once we get deeper into our first projects.</p>

    <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

    <p>Right now, I am most excited about the challenge of becoming proficient in Git and GitHub. The first two days were really difficult for me, so it will take quite a bit more effort for me to get over this hump and feel comfortable moving ahead. I'm also excited to dive into HTML and CSS, and begin to see things rendered and styled in the browser.</p>

    <h3>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>
    <p>I suppose anything unique to be learned about me from reading this blog is a look into my thought processs and how I am working through my days. I anticipate this blog being useful in backtracking to measure my progress, keeping a running record of my daily thoughts.</p>
