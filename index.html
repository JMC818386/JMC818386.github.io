        </h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

        <p>So far the first week of bootcamp has been mix of expected and unexepected experiences. Leading up to day 1, we were given a lot of material to read through which outlines what we could expect entering the first week and beyond. However, I had not anticipated having such a difficult time understanding and becoming comfortable with Git and GitHub. I am still working on assignments from the first two days, with very litle progress, but I am improving slowly each time I attempt working through the tutorials. Moving into HTML and CSS yesterday was a nice break from CLI and Git commands. I will need to spend extra time working on Git and GitHub over the coming days to ensure that I don't slow my self down once we get deeper into our first projects.</p>

        <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

        <p>Right now, I am most excited about the challenge of becoming proficient in Git and GitHub. The first two days were really difficult for me, so it will take quite a bit more effort for me to get over this hump and feel comfortable moving ahead. I'm also excited to dive into HTML and CSS, and begin to see things rendered and styled in the browser.</p>

        <h3>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>
        <p>I suppose anything unique to be learned about me from reading this blog is a look into my thought processs and how I am working through my days. I anticipate this blog being useful in backtracking to measure my progress, keeping a running record of my daily thoughts.</p>
